Brief Overview: The site I created for hw 3 for GUI 1 is pretty much a multiplication table where
it takes in about four numbers from the user where each number that is required to be inputted be
the minimum and maximum value of the first row and column. So for instance, if the user inputs 5 and 9 for
the min and max number for row and 4 and 7 for column then it would generate a table that has 5 rows
and 4 columns where the starting row and column would have the minimum value inputted and at the last row
and column would have the max value inputted and each corresponding cell based on the row and column
would have the product of the value at that row and column. So for example at the row where its value is
at 6 and the column at 7, the cell corresponding to those positions would produce 42 as 6 * 7 = 42.
